 # Ayaan's Dotfiles

 # WORK IN PROGRESS

 ## keybinds with kanata. 
kanata leverages karabiners C++ driver under the hood (virtual keyboard) 
kanata-vk-agent to have app specific layers (eg. command key becomes ctrl in 'terminal' enviroinments)

 ## theme: catppuccin
The theme is catppuccin mocha wherever possible (read convenient lol) 

 ## shell: zsh (starship prompt)

 ## most major configuratoin happens in neovim and emacs 
 hence they are managed seperately, check out their own specific repos
 (at least until i figure submodules out (if they're even the way to go about this))
